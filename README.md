# dilemma-cleaner

## Few words about this project
The goal was to create an app which helps users making decissions.  
  
Project areas:
* Prismic - headless CMS which is used in project, provides settings, translations and dilemmas setup
* API - .Net 6 project is responsible for providing data, which are cached to limit prismic usage
* FrontEnd - created with Nuxt.js v3

Everything done by me in this solution was made from scratch specially for this project.  
  
Project still needs to be developed to cover all missing features (like FE error handling) and catch up all bugs (e.g. page reload on step cause errors). Hovewer in my opinion it is good enough to be delivered as a test assestment. In the end, better is the enemy of good ;).

## Front End
  
To run the project, in the root FE folder please run:  
  
`yarn install` & `yarn dev`
